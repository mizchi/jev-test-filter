/**
 * Zero-dependency Jev client.
 *
 * Jev (TypeSafe's System One model) takes one `state` plus many independent
 * `questions` and answers them all in parallel in a single round trip. That
 * shape is the whole reason this tool can afford to ask about every test in
 * a repository: the state -- the diff -- is sent once, and each extra question
 * costs only its own text.
 *
 * Two server ceilings matter, and neither is a question count:
 *
 *   - the whole request must be under 64Ki input tokens
 *   - the `state` alone must be under 32Ki input tokens (an independent budget,
 *     and the one that fills up first)
 *
 * There is no documented cap on the NUMBER of questions; over a thousand in one
 * request is fine. `askSplitting` therefore does not try to predict the ceiling
 * precisely -- it reacts to the server's own `max_tokens_exceeded` by halving
 * the question set, which keeps the estimator below free to be
 * approximate.

 * the mirror and lowers its rate by a quarter, and a success while requests
 * have had to wait raises the rate by two percent, so a key with a higher
